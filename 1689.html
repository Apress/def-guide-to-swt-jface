<h1>Errata for The Definitive Guide to SWT and JFace</h1>
Note: Because of printing lead times, the text of the book was completed before the release of Eclipse 3.0.
The Eclipse team changed a few things in SWT and JFace during that time. This page lists those changes.

<h2>Chapter 8</h2>
<p>On page 228, we claim that tool bars are always horizontal on Windows. This is no longer the case for SWT 3.0--tool bars can now be vertical (thanks to Kyle Leveque for pointing this out).</p>
<p>On page 255, the Table styles should now include SWT.VIRTUAL, for creating a virtual table.
Virtual tables don't hold all their rows at once. Instead, they concern themselves only with those
rows that are currently visible. This is extremely useful for tables that display large amounts of data.</p>
<p>To use a virtual table, pass the SWT.VIRTUAL style to the Table's constructor. Tell the table how
many rows it contains using Table's setItemCount(int) method, and then provide a listener that's invoked
whenever the table should display new rows. The listener looks something like this:</p>
<pre>
table.addListener(SWT.SetData, new Listener() {
  public void handleEvent(Event event) {
    // event.item is the row, or TableItem, that the table must display
    TableItem item = (TableItem) event.item;
    
    // Do something with the TableItem
    item.setText(0, myData[table.indexOf(item)][0]);
    item.setText(1, myData[table.indexOf(item)][1]);
  }
});
</pre>
<p>The VirtualTable application in the Chapter 8 source code demonstrates virtual tables.</p>
<p>On page 258, the method:</p>
<pre>void showColumn(TableColumn column)</pre>
<p>should be added. This method is the horizontally-scrolling counterpart of showItem(), and scrolls
the specified column into view.</p>
<p>Tables now support setting fonts by row or even by cell. On page 261, methods should be added for getting and setting fonts.
These methods are:
<pre>
Font getFont() -- Returns the font for this TableItem
Font getFont(int index) -- Returns the font for the cell specified by index
void setFont(Font font) -- Sets the font for this TableItem
void setFont(int index, Font font) -- Sets the font for the cell specified by index
</pre>

<h2>Chapter 9</h2>
<p>On page 296, the CTabFolder style constants should now include SWT.CLOSE. 
The SWT.CLOSE style adds the close button to the tab, and is now the preferred method for doing so.
The addCTabFolderListener() method has been deprecated, although it still works to add a close button
to the tab.

<h2>Chapter 11</h2>
<p>On page 451, the styles that StyleRange now supports includes SWT.ITALIC, for
italicized text. This style can be combined with SWT.BOLD.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12</h2>
<p>On page 517, the list of platforms that support the Web browser component now includes
Mac OS X, which requires the Safari browser, as well as QNX.</p>
<p>On page 522, two Browser methods have been added: isBackEnabled() returns true if you can go back a page in the browser history, and
isForwardEnabled() returns true if you can go forward a page in the browser history
</p>

<h2>Chapter 18</h2>
<p>Pages 751 - 759 describe finding and replacing using FindReplaceDocumentAdapter. This class had an issue with repeated finds, 
as reported in Bug #52888. In a good news/bad news scenario, they fixed the bug, but broke the API. Consequently, the
FindReplaceDialog in the book will not compile.</p>
<p>The new API is easier to use, however: call FindReplaceDocumentAdapter.find() to do a find, and
FindReplaceDocumentAdapter.replace() to do a replace. The source code has been updated to use the new API.
